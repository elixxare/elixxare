## 𓇼⋆ ˚꩜ About Me  ｡ ⋆୨୧˚ 

I’m **Elina Liu**, an undergraduate at the **University of Virginia** studying **Computer Science** and **Engineering Business**. I’m interested in building **scalable systems and intelligent tools** that make complex workflows simpler, especially at the intersection of **machine learning, data infrastructure, and AI-powered applications**. I’m drawn to tech because I love problem-solving and building things that have a real, positive impact on how people live and work!

I previously interned as a **Software Development Engineer at AWS**, where I worked on large-scale database migration and analytics infrastructure, contributing to real-time data pipelines and Zero-ETL initiatives. I also have experience in **NLP research**, applying transformer-based models to large-scale sentiment analysis in an industry startup setting.

Alongside my studies, I work as a **freelance artist**, running my own creative practice in digital illustration and design - an experience that’s shaped how I think about user experience, communication, and product polish. 

In my free time, I love to oil paint, practice guitar, watch documentaries, rock climb, and crochet!
